# Rust Microservices Application

## Overview

This Rust Microservices Application is designed to showcase the development and deployment of a microservices architecture using Rust. It emphasizes the use of Docker for creating distinct compilation and runtime images, ensuring that the runtime image remains lightweight. Additionally, it demonstrates the deployment and basic networking of these microservices using Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Implements a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
- **Docker Integration**: Utilizes Docker to build separate compilation and runtime images, optimizing for a lightweight production environment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Demonstrates the deployment of microservices on Kubernetes, including the setup of basic networking and service discovery.
- **Efficient Rust Development**: Leverages Rust's performance and safety features to build robust and efficient microservices.
- **Lightweight Runtime**: Ensures the runtime image is minimal, containing only the necessary binaries and dependencies for running the microservices.
